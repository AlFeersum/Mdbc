SHORT DESCRIPTION
    MongoDB cmdlets based on the official C# driver.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The module provides the following cmdlets and tools:

    Connect, set the default server, database, and collection:

        Connect-Mdbc

    Add, get, remove, and update documents:

        Add-MdbcData
        Get-MdbcData
        Remove-MdbcData
        Update-MdbcData

    Create new documents, e.g. for Add-MdbcData, Export-MdbcData:

        New-MdbcData

    Create update expressions, e.g. for Update-MdbcData:

        New-MdbcUpdate

    Create queries, e.g. for Get-MdbcData, Update-MdbcData:

        New-MdbcQuery

    Add collections with special properties, e.g. capped:

        Add-MdbcCollection

    Invoke map and reduce:

        Invoke-MdbcMapReduce

    Invoke MongoDB commands including not covered by Mdbc or C# driver:

        Invoke-MdbcCommand

    Bson file data persistence even without MongoDB:

        Export-MdbcData
        Import-MdbcData

    Bson file collections even without MongoDB:

        Open-MdbcFile
        Save-MdbcFile

    Some more features for interactive sessions:

        Mdbc.ps1

FILE COLLECTIONS
    Mdbc introduces bson data file collections which do not require MongoDB.
    They are opened and saved by Open-MdbcFile and Save-MdbcFile and support
    commands Get-MdbcData, Add-MdbcData, Remove-MdbcData, and Update-MdbcData.

    File collections keep data in memory. Unique _id are maintained by default.
    The above cmdlets should work with files as with usual MongoDB collections
    with some known differences.

    KNOWN DIFFERENCES

    Invalid element names *.*, $*

        Documents obtained from MongoDB collections do not have elements with
        invalid names.

        File collections read documents from files as they are, element names
        are not checked. This is not a problem for files created and maintained
        by Open|Save-MdbcData and Add|Remove|Update-MdbcData, names are checked
        on insertions. Other files, like created by Export-MdbcData, may have
        issues if they contain invalid names.

    Terminating errors

        MongoException exceptions are caught by Mdbc cmdlets and converted into
        not terminating errors.

        Exceptions from file collections are not currently caught. Thus, all
        exceptions result in terminating errors.

    Not supported for file collections

        * Parameter Result in Add-MdbcData, Remove-MdbcData, Update-MdbcData
        * Parameter Cursor in Get-MdbcData
        * Command Invoke-MdbcAggregate
        * Command Invoke-MdbcMapReduce

    Not supported for simple data (no _id)

        * Parameter Update in Add-MdbcData
